# Python Keylogger

Simple implementaton of a keylogger on Python for learning sockets

* Easier to use it when built using pyinstaller 
* Obviously not meant for actual malicious use. Not even sure how that would be possible
# TODO

- [ ] Add key combinations, currently not handing ctrl+backspace commands properly by emptying char buffers
